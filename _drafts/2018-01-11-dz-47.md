*Will Director Stu allow Writer Chas on his set?* Following our annual wrap up in 2017, we’ve decided to once again explore what craft issues/lessons we can garner from the latest Stars, namely Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, focusing on how consequences of character actions can do a lot of heavy lifting as to how the audience perceives that character (as well as looking at worldview and overall story structure). We also discuss how the sexual assault allegations in our industry can impact on what work we choose to analyse as well as dive into a bunch of listener questions. We end on whether - if our space pirates project gets off the ground - Chas should come on set, whether Stu will have him and whether it would do anyone any good. As always: **SPOILERS ABOUND** Audio quotations used for educational purposes only. Timestamps indicated below. Chapter markers included in the mp3. Special thanks to our Patreon supporters.
