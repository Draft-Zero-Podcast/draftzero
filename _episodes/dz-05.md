**INT. EPISODE 5 - MIDDAY** *Can forcing your audience to ask questions - and then answering them - trigger an emotional response?* Stu and Chas delve into audience point of view - not character point of view! Does your audience know more, less or the same as your characters? And does changing this within a scene trigger or heighten the desired emotional response? To test this theory, we look to the genre that changes the audience's point of view the most: thrillers. So we analyse scenes and sequences from THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, ZERO DARK THIRTY and ARGO. As usual though, we can't help ourselves and also consider scenes from GROUNDHOG DAY, PHILOMENA and - of course - Stu refers to STAR WARS. **LINKS**
