https://youtu.be/KrMfktP7osE *Workshopping ways to fix character motivations.* In this second part of their exploration of character motivations, Chas and Stu dive into what makes “BAD” screenplays NOT work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They examine at moments where they (and maybe you, dear listeners) did not believe a key decision being made by a character and so were taken out of the movie. In a departure from the Draft Zero format, they apply the tools they developed in Part 1 to workshop potential fixes to these beats. Character decisions that come under the microscope are AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR (again), SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY, DIE HARD (*which is a good example for contrast, not a bad one!*), PREDATOR 2, SICARIO 2: DÍA DEL SOLDADO and PROMETHEUS (with an honourable mention to A PRINCESS BRIDE). Let us know if you like the variation on our format or not! As always: **SPOILERS ABOUND**! Audio quotations used for educational purposes only. Timestamps indicated below.
