*How can we make our screenwriting more appealing to Actors?* In this episode, Chas and Stu are joined by a very special guest, SARAH SNOOK - star of Predestination, Jessabelle, and Oddball, amongst many others - to discuss ACTING and it's relationship with WRITING. We focus our analysis on two scenes from AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY, a screenplay that started life as a Pulitzer Prize winning play, and whose writer - Tracy Letts - is a successful actor in his own right. But, as usual, we ice-skate between a whole range of topics,  including what attracts actors to a script, writing realistic characters, how actors analyse scenes, character spines & objectives, and the importance of hugs. **LINKS**
