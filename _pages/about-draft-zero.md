**INT. ABOUT PAGE - NIGHT** Two emerging screenwriters – Chas Fisher and Stuart Willis - try to work out what makes great screenplays work. Discovering what it takes by analysing what successful writers put on the page -- and then talking/discussing/arguing about it in a podcast. *Monthly*. Let’s not get carried away here. [**Chas Fisher**][1] grew up in Argentina, Egypt, India and France. As a result, he is committed to writing social justice stories… so long as they feature pirates or werewolves or werewolf-pirates! **[Stuart Willis][2]** is an award-winning writer & director of elevated genre. His writing has been nominated for four Writer's Guild awards. As a director, he has screened at numerous international festivals, been shortlisted for the world-famous TropFest TWICE, and is currently finishing post-production on RESTORATION an online-miniseries due for release in 2016. His other credits include PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, THE LEGO MOVIE, HARRY POTTER. DZ logo design by <a href="http://lisacookson.com" target="_blank">Lisa Cookson</a>.
