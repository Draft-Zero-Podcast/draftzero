## Intro: Vs Self {#chapter}

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:34]</small> <span title="0:34 - 0:48">we are trying to work out what makes great antagonistic forces work this is part 2 of a series on forces of antagonism if you ever listened to part one we really recommend you start there otherwise you might get a little bit lost.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:48]</small> <span title="0:48 - 0:51">Because we're just going to make references to stuff that you haven't heard.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:51]</small> <span title="0:51 - 1:01">Any Miss part of an episode we are going to be talking about self we going to talk about where the antagonistic force is the self against,</span> <span title="1:01 - 1:08">broadly speaking the protagonist but it could be the main character could be the point of view character it could be I don't know.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:08]</small> <span title="1:08 - 1:17">1 important sit there a distinction I am going to reiterate from last episode is we did distinguish between antagonist as.</span> <span title="1:18 - 1:28">Being an obstacle that creates conflict and and as a antagonist I mean antagonistic forces and antagonist as a force of change on.</span> <span title="1:29 - 1:30">Protagonist.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:30]</small> <span title="1:30 - 1:34">I am your antagonistic oils.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:34]</small> <span title="1:34 - 1:48">My point being the three films that we decided to look at it as get me many times as we got a huge list of films to reference but the three films were going to explore in detail from the lens of how.</span> <span title="1:49 - 1:54">The protagonist himself is the main source of antagonistic force are.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:54]</small> <span title="1:54 - 2:00">Little Miss Sunshine Shane Monster and if you get to it will talk a little bit about the TV series mindhunters.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:59]</small> <span title="1:59 - 2:01">Are we gonna do them in that order.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[2:00]</small> <span title="2:00 - 2:05">Yeah I mean to me sometimes in Campbelltown.</span> <span title="2:07 - 2:13">Where I would like to start because I think this is an important Distinction is it there is a category of found in which,</span> <span title="2:13 - 2:22">the internal conflict the vs Self conflict is externalised quite literally in a secondary character so in Fight Club,</span> <span title="2:22 - 2:31">there is dirt Jack and there is Tyler durden that is about the inner conflict between Jack and tornado and then he's manifested exceptionally,</span> <span title="2:31 - 2:40">notably with Tyler durden being Brad Pitt you know the manifestation of his kind of inner desires of who wants me but also Black Swan.</span> <span title="2:40 - 2:44">The internal conflict of Natalie Portman character whose name gave me.</span> <span title="2:45 - 2:55">Is um whether it's hurting me with mental illness all the pressure is have a job is manifested in another character in inside out the internal conflicts of the girl.</span> <span title="2:55 - 3:09">I manifested in Iron Man movies Cage's and I get like home and head before that just like inside out for adults like the conflict of Hermans was manifested with all these cases cause I think what is challenging about this what was challenge about this topic,</span> <span title="3:08 - 3:16">is the bees and every all getting the detail of that when you are dealing on a dramatise screen story.</span> <span title="3:16 - 3:31">If you were dealing with internal conflicts that you have to find ways to traumatise it which means that you end up putting things out to external complex weather there pot complex what character complex he's out these internal storage kind of a category of.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[3:31]</small> <span title="3:31 - 3:37">The most of you genre that relates to self is the addiction movie which is kind of,</span> <span title="3:37 - 3:49">you know thinking Leaving Las Vegas or postcards for the edge or presentation Cage's dealing with their addiction but their addiction becomes a form it creates the obstacles and creates the.</span> <span title="3:49 - 3:55">The forces of change for these characters to either submit to their addiction or to overcome.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[3:55]</small> <span title="3:55 - 4:08">Weather thing they have to come over come while they may still be external sources of antagonist that either inspire them or push them back into their addiction what they have to overcome as themselves.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[4:08]</small> <span title="4:08 - 4:16">We have decided to not really only look at those films because they ultimately if you external I can fight club.</span> <span title="4:16 - 4:23">Text analyse that struggle to Tyler durden coming antagonist really it's a VS.</span> <span title="4:23 - 4:32">Human story like the weight dramatically the destroyed works and in terms of the way you structure your sequences in your scenes and the dramatic questions you ask but come.</span> <span title="4:33 - 4:45">Becoming a person that's completely Gin and I trying to say it's the wrong way to do it it's just that they sold their dramatisation Problems by kinda pushing into another Style,</span> <span title="4:45 - 4:54">and as we will get to what is interesting as in the vs nature films the way they manifest the internal character stuff is through or off and through.</span> <span title="4:55 - 5:04">Environmental factors so we'll try this kind of left us with a little bit more of it in between Meadows genre of stories where the,</span> <span title="5:04 - 5:13">character question drove the story to be internal conflict of the characters drove the story but was not externalising to quite the same extent.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[5:13]</small> <span title="5:13 - 5:15">Yes.</span> 
## Little Miss Sunshine {#chapter}

**Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[5:15]</small> <span title="5:15 - 5:16">Mister Maker Miss Sunshine.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[5:52]</small> <span title="5:52 - 6:05">Sunshine.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[6:08]</small> <span title="6:08 - 6:15">I think look I think it's interesting because it's it's not a bit while first put flight it but it's also not a film.</span> <span title="6:15 - 6:25">That I think most people would think of because it's an ensemble moving because it's a comedy where most of the antagonistic forces are actually.</span> <span title="6:25 - 6:27">Sprouting from.</span> <span title="6:28 - 6:36">The protagonist himself and I say himself deliberately because in the context of this film it's the Greg Kinnear character if we looking.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[6:36]</small> <span title="6:36 - 6:37">Richard.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[6:37]</small> <span title="6:37 - 6:42">Richard yeah if we looking at protagonist as.</span> <span title="6:42 - 6:52">From the very specific definition of who takes the first action and who drives the plot it is Richard who makes all the decisions.</span> <span title="6:52 - 7:02">The drive the plot he gets to choose whether they go to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant he decides to drive off and visit that.</span> <span title="7:03 - 7:07">Publisher horror members name play by Bryan Cranston he.</span> <span title="7:08 - 7:21">Famously is the one that decides to kidnap his fathers dead body from the hospital and drive off and finally he's the one who decides to get up on stage and dance with his daughter.</span> <span title="7:21 - 7:28">Piercing control the part that's not to say that it is in an ensemble film where every other character has.</span> <span title="7:28 - 7:37">You know wonderful journeys and moments I think possibly Toni Collette is the only one that the only character that's the his wife is.</span> <span title="7:37 - 7:47">Really poorly serviced by the film but in that film nearly business so many obstacles I mean wonderfully is.</span> <span title="7:47 - 7:48">The car.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[7:49]</small> <span title="7:49 - 7:51">The Garrett song.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[7:50]</small> <span title="7:50 - 7:58">The vet did they come as they go driving starts breaking down to the point that they can't actually stop the car.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:00]</small> <span title="8:00 - 8:12">So what did you know this this all bosses you don't need the clutch to change from from the 3rd to the 4th you only really need the clutch to go from number 1 to number.</span> <span title="8:13 - 8:23">As long as you keep forgetting 24 hour you start and then you go for 34.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:24]</small> <span title="8:24 - 8:27">What if you're not on a hill.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:45]</small> <span title="8:45 - 8:51">But I do like loops around buildings and things Lygon has to run in and get in and then.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:51]</small> <span title="8:51 - 8:55">Put the movie Speed it was the BIG W that couldn't slow down.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:52]</small> <span title="8:52 - 9:00">And then and then the horn breaks and the horn is constantly going off.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:58]</small> <span title="8:58 - 9:03">You cut me off.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:03]</small> <span title="9:03 - 9:11">To the point where the horn breaking down gets the police get attract the attention of a highway patrol to pull them over.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:20]</small> <span title="9:20 - 9:23">The pull the motor when they got the dead body wake up.</span> <span title="9:24 - 9:28">Of fair isle of his dad in the back of the car,</span> <span title="9:28 - 9:39">example with a force of antagonism VW itself but that only came into being that force of antagonism actually float from Grand Canyon absolute.</span> <span title="9:39 - 9:46">Meat box movies want to put his daughter to prove his theories about I don't know.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:45]</small> <span title="9:45 - 9:46">Winners and Losers.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:46]</small> <span title="9:46 - 9:48">Winners and losers correct.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:48]</small> <span title="9:48 - 10:03">I mean that that's the thing like the his whole character journey is trying to set up a career as a writer and content creator and you know motivational speaker around a self help program but there is 7.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[10:03]</small> <span title="10:03 - 10:05">Not doing very well himself.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[10:04]</small> <span title="10:04 - 10:09">His 7 Step Program defines everyone as winners or losers.</span> <span title="10:09 - 10:23">And in which he is constantly measuring people as winners or losers and yet as you say you know the irony is he's constantly losing but he's making all of his decisions based on would a winner do this all would a loser do this.</span> <span title="10:23 - 10:26">In his within his paradigm.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[10:25]</small> <span title="10:25 - 10:40">So it's much as you say coming back to walk to him out in part one as much as you can say he's the protagonist of this story he's also the antagonist because he's journey by dragging in the rest of his family forces them to also clinic confront their own.</span> <span title="10:40 -

27:58">what's the pornography in men in the film uses visual storytelling in a great way to set this up and,</span> <span title="27:58 - 28:08">but even I guess that's moment of him on there the train worry it's incredibly simply shot found but we make eye contact with woman is but it's very sensual and very sexual.</span> <span title="28:09 -

29:06">I mean that that is the one.</span> <span title="29:06 - 29:15">I think plot question in a very character driven film the only kind of question is Will his.</span> <span title="29:15 - 29:24">What are the ramifications of his work computer coming back no doubt loaded with porn it's the only kind of sort of hanging.</span> <span title="29:24 -

42:31">Yes.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[42:31]</small> <span title="42:31 - 42:42">Ok so Brandon as previously flirted across the work office space with a coworker call Marianne and.</span> <span title="42:42 - 42:50">After the the night of a obvious sister sleeping with his boss he asked her out on a date.</span> <span title="42:51 - 42:55">And it's just a proper dinner date it's actually.</span> <span title="42:55 - 43:09">You got a sensibly not a very good date you know like it feels very awkward a lot of it is in one single take where it doesn't feel like they're having a super close connection you know.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[43:09]</small> <span title="43:09 -

43:44">If you had a choice to live in the past or the future.</span> <span title="43:45 - 43:56">Could be anything you wanted to be I would you be less boring.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[43:56]</small> <span title="43:56 - 44:10">The worst thing you could say on a first date and the date ends in there like at the moment where should they kiss should they not and she just walks away but the point is it's so wonderful because he's actually striving for a,</span> <span title="44:10 - 44:17">a human human connection at like humans not the right way but in is driving for intimacy not sex.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[44:17]</small> <span title="44:17 - 44:27">And he goes home after that and I'm pretty sure at least that's when sissy discovers him masturbating and they have their argument.</span> <span title="44:27 - 44:38">And that leads to him find his laptop etc etc and basically at that point he then disposes of all his pornography you.</span> <span title="44:39 - 44:42">That laptop and all the other sex related stuff.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[44:42]</small> <span title="44:42 - 44:43">And.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[44:43]</small> <span title="44:43 - 44:46">Anyways, cleansing himself a bit addictive lifestyle.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[44:46]</small> <span title="44:46 - 45:01">Correct so he did that that's what he's and the very next scene is him at going in late getting Marianne out of work and heading to a hotel where he's previously seen someone else having sex through the hotel.</span> <span title="45:01 - 45:06">Window and there he tries to have.</span> <span title="45:07 - 45:21">An intimate sexual experience and he can't he's impotent and this is obviously my point being in those previous things that you're talking about he's not been there and the protagonist.</span> <span title="45:21 - 45:32">In this scene he's clearly the protagonist and she is clearly the antagonistic forced she's the dramatic representation of him defeating his obstacle which is his sex addiction.</span> <span title="45:32 - 45:38">She is calling him to overcome his to choose his need over his want.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[45:38]</small> <span title="45:38 - 45:41">Marianne azure.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[45:40]</small> <span title="45:40 - 45:44">Yeah Marianne is and I think his sister as well right.</span> <span title="45:45 - 45:54">So they clearly human antagonistic forces and I use that in terms of their calling for him to change not just presenting obstacles.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[45:54]</small> <span title="45:54 - 45:55">Yep.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[45:55]</small> <span title="45:55 - 46:01">AT-AT in contrast to the other scenes and he can't do it he's impotent his addiction wins.</span> <span title="46:01 - 46:15">And she leaves and he calls a prostitute to come so that they can engage in the exact same sexual act that he saw through the window and that's starts his spiral of series of.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[46:14]</small> <span title="46:14 - 46:16">He gives into his addiction.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[46:16]</small> <span title="46:16 - 46:18">You just fully dives into it.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[46:17]</small> <span title="46:17 - 46:22">So he goes home and kicks out his sister.</span> <span title="46:23 - 46:34">After she's like you know it's an amazing chain but it's Sheen is amazing scene I'm in tears talking about how they need to help each other and he basically said she's irresponsible of Burden.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[46:34]</small> <span title="46:34 - 46:42">You come in here and you're a wait on me do you understand me you're a burden you've just fucking dragging me down.</span> <span title="46:43 - 46:54">How are you helping me you can even clean up after yourself gone now.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[46:54]</small> <span title="46:54 - 47:00">Chief this is the antagonist in today's middle section of the film because she is morning challenges him,</span> <span title="47:00 - 47:14">and when doesn't like where that leads him he throws her out he reject his antagonist and then gives into his addiction which is this incredible sequence of him hitting rock bottom.</span> <span title="47:14 - 47:20">You know we end up going to a gay bar we hooks up with them and then you guys had sex with prostitutes like it's query.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[47:20]</small> <span title="47:20 - 47:31">So it's 3 different sexual encounters you've talked about the last two the first one is he hits on a woman in a bar and gets into a fight as a result.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[47:31]</small> <span title="47:31 - 47:41">With it because he basically hits on to her explain to her in graphic detail what he wants to do to her boyfriend comes over and says what did you say to her and he tells him.</span> <span title="47:41 - 47:51">You pick a fight and then he beats up he beats up Brandon and that leads to the other two sexual counted and when she is on the way home,</span> <span title="47:51 - 48:00">on the trains very cleverly user point of view because with this point it's established it's Izzy is someone that self-harm so there's a moment early on,</span> <span title="48:00 - 48:06">where she's like teetering on the edge of the subway platform that we're on on the subway,</span> <span title="48:06 - 48:13">and they asked to leave the play ever last leave the train because of a police emergency he tried to call sissy she does not answer,</span> <span title="48:13 - 48:20">someone's his attention become moves from his sexual needs to concerned for his sister,</span> <span title="48:20 - 48:24">and we wonder if it was her that committed suicide on the train tracks.</span> <span title="48:25 - 48:32">And ultimately he finds her in the bathroom of his flat covered in blood she's flashed her wrists.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[48:31]</small> <span title="48:31 - 48:41">So you know here is a clear movie where whatever plot obstacles are created by his addiction and.</span> <span title="48:42 - 48:54">His need is a character is to get over that addiction that is creating what few plot obstacles there are I mean the fact is his computer comes back full of porn and they say.</span> <span title="48:54 - 48:58">I was filthy some hacker must have got into it or something like that.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[48:58]</small> <span title="48:58 - 49:03">In those intern I think they blame David suggested it was his intern.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[49:04]</small> <span title="49:04 - 49:09">Your hard drive is still see right we got your computer back I mean it is it is dirty.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[49:11]</small> <span title="49:11 - 49:22">Things you're in town I might try someone's fuck up now with low and high wide and cash in on pics of really really sick fux spend all day on that shit.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[49:22]</small> <span title="49:22 - 49:29">Earlier in the film it's got a feeling it happens after.</span> <span title="49:30 - 49:33">David Flint certificate somewhere year Kinder.</span> <span title="49:33 - 49:47">Either but a million is interesting moment she's basically incessantly call David but she's kind of like a glove at it like she's her behaviour is obsessive in the same way that that Brandon's behave is obsessive just manifest in different ways.</span> <span title="49:47 - 49:53">The final this is interesting me this is a binary choice and present it's a Heroes,</span> <span title="49:53 - 50:05">3 hours like an action movie is bit branding and sitting in the subway train and we noticed the woman for the NFL wearing engagement ring all the married whether she's married now and she starts looking at him,</span> <span title="50:06 - 50:08">I eating him on for like a bit of word.</span> <span title="50:08 - 50:17">At least you to start flirting with him and Brandon kinda blows into it but when she leaves as opposed to him following her he doesn't,</span> <span title="50:18 - 50:22">that is the extent of his character change over the course of the film.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[50:22]</small> <span title="50:22 - 50:23">Yes.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[50:23]</small> <span title="50:23 - 50:33">But it's clear that I can turns of a binder just represent change you the stands follows her or doesn't and he doesn't give into these issues free to feed his addiction.</span> <span title="50:33 - 50:38">But you feel like maybe his Focus has shift.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[50:38]</small> <span title="50:38 - 50:47">Well I think he's the change I think he wants to yeah where is I think in the beginning of the film he didn't have any desire to change.</span> <span title="50:47 - 51:00">He didn't see any downside to his addiction I mean we're not the seeing the combination of him giving into his addiction to sequence worries ending up having sex with two prostitutes at the same time.</span> <span title="51:01 - 51:09">It's extremely graphic but there's also it ends with it almost looks like he's an animal.</span> <span title="51:09 - 51:23">And it ends with this haunted look on his face and it it's it's usually confronting an incredible performance moment that I don't know how they wrote that on the page I think.</span> <span title="51:24 - 51:29">Get fast member to act but yes it is it is a a film that a is.</span> <span title="51:30 - 51:42">The remarkable you know plus I think we had trouble finding films where the self is the main antagonist I feel that this is a really great example of that.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[51:42]</small> <span title="51:42 - 51:56">But they had to find keep it to maintain it they brought in sissy because I don't think in the sense of her being a force for change your arrival I don't think would have randomly kept on living.</span> <span title="51:57 - 51:59">The life he was living until her alright.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[51:59]</small> <span title="51:59 - 52:03">Yeah and his boss is a source of antagonism because.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[52:04]</small> <span title="52:04 - 52:06">Heath Ledger.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[52:06]</small> <span title="52:06 - 52:13">Yeah babe it's not just that I think he sees him as a maybe a sex addict but I'm not that.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[52:13]</small> <span title="52:13 - 52:22">You're a dependency you're a parasite.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[52:25]</small> <span title="52:25 - 52:33">Yeah I'm not I know who I am I and yes conversation about a with Marianne about how it doesn't leak and commitment.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[52:33]</small> <span title="52:33 - 52:47">One person for the rest of your life and I mean you come to restaurant cc couple sitting together and they only speak to another day they all have anything to say they all have anything that we don't want to speak to you later.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[52:49]</small> <span title="52:49 - 52:51">Or they just bought.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[52:51]</small> <span title="52:51 - 53:01">So he's like he is clear that he is the Israelite which is prolly why is having sex with prostitutes and stuff like that is very clear about that transaction will make sure of his relationship.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[53:01]</small> <span title="53:01 - 53:12">Is how I put it I think if he were asked who respects women more you or your boss he would handsome say I respect women more and I think the film betrays him as respecting women more.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[53:12]</small> <span title="53:12 - 53:18">Yeah in in its own his own way which is his honest.</span> <span title="53:18 - 53:32">I think it's I don't think that's a respect but I think he's honest just want to try trying to show you as a permanent is essentially character story about someone that's in an addict filmed it does external has its non-offensive antagonism.</span> <span title="53:32 - 53:41">And even if the journey of internal put fines away but the question is asked at the beginning of a character question and that force that antagonistic.</span> <span title="53:41 - 53:53">Boss this is Kai animal nature as manifested or demonstrated will dramatise by him running after the married woman is answered by the end of the felt metallic frames it's story.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[53:53]</small> <span title="53:53 - 53:57">So shall we we dive into Monster.</span> 
## Monster {#chapter}

**Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[53:57]</small> <span title="53:57 - 54:03">Before we get into Monster oh just a bit of a warning up front is this is a film is pretty,</span> <span title="54:03 - 54:14">heavy going it's a true story about a real life serial killer and deals with sexual assault sexual violence and molestation.</span> <span title="54:14 - 54:23">On top of all the killing so if you're sensitive just such discussions please feel free to skip forward to the next chapter.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[54:34]</small> <span title="54:34 - 54:40">Trying to make some cash.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[54:58]</small> <span title="54:58 - 55:04">Little ride to question are you from Batman.</span> <span title="55:04 - 55:13">You got it I got it under control now.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[55:28]</small> <span title="55:28 - 55:34">Hey would you call it a biopic I don't really know how dramatised it is.</span> <span title="55:35 - 55:45">Or not but it's ostensibly about the the life of Aileen wuornos who was a no famous female serial killer.</span> <span title="55:46 - 55:52">In the US and when I suggested this is an example of.</span> <span title="55:52 - 55:59">Where the main antagonist is the the protagonist in oa vs Self example you'll like,</span> <span title="55:59 - 56:10">is it and I thought about it for a second and then been a long time since I watch the movie and I'm like you know what I'm not too sure I could be completely wrong on that front but after having rewatch the film I think it.</span> <span title="56:10 - 56:18">It leans very heavily onto your review that sequences have protagonist in.</span> <span title="56:18 - 56:32">Antagonist and that they can change and I definitely think in the first half of this movie she is not her own antagonist there are external antagonists which we can talk about but in the second half of the film and in fact.</span> <span title="56:32 - 56:39">The whole thematic question of the film is about whether she had choice and what she did or not.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[56:40]</small> <span title="56:40 - 56:47">So to summarise the story is that Aileen moves to Florida.</span> <span title="56:48 -

57:50">Sway this is a serial killer film,</span> <span title="57:50 - 58:03">where we find me where we're in the point of view that I print a message this you will keala settle why I guess it's like The Killer Inside Me which I haven't seen you don't better something gangster can like Scarface even though I've got those.</span> <span title="58:03 - 58:15">Gangsters in fucking murder is motherfuckers anyway but this makes feel make some certain choices to have a frame this journey of a character and the antagonism it is presented to Hayley but I think this is where you want to go.</span> <span title="58:15 -

1:07:54">I think this is a decision that the film is made well not the film Patty Jenkins who wrote and directed it Patty Jenkins has chosen to frame the pound so as I explained that she.</span> <span title="1:07:54 - 1:07:58">They have Peter the backstory of.</span> <span title="1:07:58 - 1:08:07">Aileen that at the beginning we feel like it's consensual her choosing to sleep with boys because she wants to be a movie star and then we realise it a backstories more Sinister that,</span> <span title="1:08:07 -

1:08:26">Because effectively her like father of Mum by her father left and she was raised by grandparents at them sold the red spot whatever the specific details maybe.</span> <span title="1:08:27 - 1:08:33">The film could have opened in that way that will very sympathetic and it was presented her.</span> <span title="1:08:34 - 1:08:43">Quite clear const from first action to like the first moment to final consequence would have been it the serial killing me his men.</span> <span title="1:08:43 - 1:08:53">Her killing his name was a consequence of that instead the film is framing at you're still open with a voice over and it's kind of her naivety or her head delusion about her upbringing.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:08:53]</small> <span title="1:08:53 -

1:10:16">Any sequence ends with her under a bridge playing with a gun and thinking about suicide there is a clear line to him what she is saying in the voice over.</span> <span title="1:10:16 - 1:10:21">What we see is Unfolding in her life and where she ends up at the beginning of our story.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:10:21]</small> <span title="1:10:21 - 1:10:28">By the time I'm at Selby wall.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:10:28]</small> <span title="1:10:28 - 1:10:32">If the first meal question the film ask is a character question,</span> <span title="1:10:32 - 1:10:46">will Aileen kill herself in a way and she didn't kill herself but it's will be harm herself or why does she want to hurt herself why what is the battle that her thing contemplating suicide is a character question and make sure that what you mean Selby.</span> <span title="1:10:46 - 1:10:52">This is very similar structure leads what saying did which is that the destructive behaviour of.</span> <span title="1:10:53 - 1:11:01">Brandon is a first date elective behaviours both with her sleeping with young boys are showing them her,</span> <span title="1:11:02 - 1:11:16">I'm taking a talking to him a tips and stuff like that pretty young age I meant don't connect Matt to a suicide we see her destructive behaviour at the beginning we don't see the destruction or damage that was done to her we see the damage that you trying to do with herself and I think that then,</span> <span title="1:11:16 - 1:11:17">colours,</span> <span title="1:11:17 - 1:11:29">the rest of the film and I think cause of the question and I'm an idea that the kind of antagonistic question or that the question that you're asking very early on to find the primary and take us for primary complex of the story.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:11:29]</small> <span title="1:11:29 - 1:11:40">Yep and you have to the right in terms of structure structure is very important to this is those details about what was done to her or only revealed.</span> <span title="1:11:41 - 1:11:48">They're not they're reveal before the final murder but they're revealed after the murder of the former police officer and.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:11:48]</small> <span title="1:11:48 - 1:11:50">I thought you told Sophie.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:11:50]</small> <span title="1:11:50 - 1:11:52">She tell Selby some things.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:11:52]</small> <span title="1:11:52 - 1:12:06">My brothers and sisters groupme Royal my dad killed himself will run on the streets and the neighbours it let them stay over but only if I'd in Tagalog you now so I steer clear but I'm having money now.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:12:08]</small> <span title="1:12:08 -

1:13:02">But not there about the childhood sexual abuse she's she says like I've had a tough life and it's hinted at by doing that.</span> <span title="1:13:02 - 1:13:15">The film is very deliberately not positive her as a victim at the effect of her past but as someone with agency and choice and several those Motors.</span> <span title="1:13:15 - 1:13:23">I very much like I think the first one when she comes back the the ever said the sound and the performance.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:13:29]</small> <span title="1:13:29 - 1:13:32">It's not a choice.</span> <span title="1:13:32 - 1:13:46">But some of the other ones are a choice the fact that they've shown her letting one of them go shows that it's a choice the fact that the last murder victim is screaming you don't have to do this and she's crying as she does it.</span> <span title="1:13:48 - 1:14:02">And the fact that you've had two conversations before there's outside of the murders where they're discussing are you at the effect of your upbringing or do you have choice to me means it's you know.</span> <span title="1:14:03 - 1:14:10">The entire back half of the movie she is her own source of complex.</span> <span title="1:14:11 - 1:14:16">She is the obstacle that needs to be overcome and the obstacle that Selby needs to overcome.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:14:16]</small> <span title="1:14:16 - 1:14:20">In each of the yes she's the optical.</span> <span title="1:14:20 - 1:14:33">And each of the victims are antagonists in a sense that they challenge her preconceptions they me challenge it too late so she cute and the detectives is very.</span> <span title="1:14:34 - 1:14:42">Kind and gentle compared to some of the others suburb ex police officer but he has a weapon he didn't tell her about any won't explain it to her.</span> <span title="1:14:43 - 1:14:45">Reasons of a come clear afterwards.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:14:45]</small> <span title="1:14:45 - 1:14:58">Vs Gatorade here I was good fucking gun in it show people have.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:14:58]</small> <span title="1:14:58 - 1:15:05">So each of those victims actually challenges her and are a form of antagonist which in that scene right.</span> <span title="1:15:06 - 1:15:13">I mean I mean by the credit conflict that is resolved by killing them or not in most cases she kills them except for the guy that she.</span> <span title="1:15:13 - 1:15:17">Ago but we didn't actually been running run into the woods.</span> <span title="1:15:18 - 1:15:29">It's a cheesy ok you meant very quick hand job and that was it and so this is interesting cuz I guess what were trying to drive it is as much as that these these primary can fix weather it's vs.</span> <span title="1:15:29 - 1:15:34">Dresses other people v humans over self always looking into vs nature.</span> <span title="1:15:35 - 1:15:39">The primary Conflict for me to find by the larger structure the outside in the inside of the film.</span> <span title="1:15:40 - 1:15:45">In this case the outside of the film is this kind of doing her of her accepting who she is or.</span> <span title="1:15:46 - 1:15:59">And in his cases got a court case same as a similar kind of thing is back journey of him coming to terms of his addiction we have Greg Richards character in Little Miss Sunshine that Pony Alpha 2 from the inside antagonistic forces a different,</span> <span title="1:15:59 - 1:16:03">I do kind of challenge what be challenging is different.</span> <span title="1:16:04 - 1:16:09">Image that the optical seems to have come is as you say internal and I guess compared to the other films.</span> <span title="1:16:10 - 1:16:18">That we did in the previous part those what they of schools that need to overcome internal but they're not the creation of Mrs right it's complicated right.</span> <span title="1:16:18 - 1:16:25">Like are they could you say that they're friends with woman character in three billboards first to self.</span> <span title="1:16:26 - 1:16:30">Maybe I get to yours and crater in conflict pictures of T-Rex the signs.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:16:29]</small> <span title="1:16:29 - 1:16:31">Yep what a thing.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:16:30]</small> <span title="1:16:30 - 1:16:32">To pick a fight just using to pick up.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:16:32]</small> <span title="1:16:32 - 1:16:41">Yeah yeah so I think early on the the antagonist the way that that film is structured.</span> <span title="1:16:41 - 1:16:46">Presentz Willoughby early on and Dixon as her antagonist right.</span> <span title="1:16:46 - 1:16:57">And their external to hurt but that in that episode a reference that scene where she's she's by herself in bed lying in bed and she's like talking to herself about what she should do.</span> <span title="1:16:57 - 1:17:07">And she chooses violence in that moment she is her own and agonist she's the obstacle to the change.</span> <span title="1:17:07 - 1:17:09">To her need.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:17:09]</small> <span title="1:17:09 - 1:17:14">Yeah yeah and I guess in my Monster as well like Selby.</span> <span title="1:17:15 - 1:17:21">Yeah I'm in such a romantic comedy because in the end they have they are like La La Land Selby.</span> <span title="1:17:22 -

1:17:49">Moelis times on the angry it makes it clear that Selby was the only person that Selby was not responsible at all they had no idea what's going on but we have the audience know his lunch.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:17:49]</small> <span title="1:17:49 -

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:20:25]</small> <span title="1:20:25 - 1:20:35">The reason that the whole middle actor the film is Simba choosing not to go back to confront his his past it is entirely an internal.</span> <span title="1:20:36 - 1:20:43">Although the repercussions of what's happening back in the pride lands are as a relation as a direct result of him and he's internal.</span> <span title="1:20:44 - 1:20:47">Decision so I think you know we.</span> <span title="1:20:48 - 1:20:59">When we were looking at films herself under this very strict paradigm it felt the we were you know either being tip towards films that don't really get made any more like a very sort of.</span> <span title="1:20:59 - 1:21:02">You know new wave 70s.</span> <span title="1:21:02 - 1:21:15">Cinema or we were getting tip towards more ArtHouse films but I really enjoyed the fact that we've looked at Little Miss Sunshine and you know we've got examples on here like.</span> <span title="1:21:16 - 1:21:17">The Lion King.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:21:17]</small> <span title="1:21:17 - 1:21:26">Rereading that question now but give him were kind of like someone halfway through our breakdown.</span> <span title="1:21:26 - 1:21:33">Is Christmas actually specifically about the lack of a primary antagonist and I think.</span> <span title="1:21:34 - 1:21:42">Will be with mooring fees question later on but I think hopefully this at the halfway point of our four key conflict areas is that.</span> <span title="1:21:42 - 1:21:53">Yes in humans vs humans vs Self as Premier antagonistic being forced to manifest in more ways multiple ways and.</span> <span title="1:21:53 - 1:22:01">In an example of the mindhunter monster shame Little Miss Sunshine there is a primary antagonist or primary villain.</span> <span title="1:22:01 - 1:22:13">Force of change that can be the entire that the proteins in cells that wees to all these things these decisions and I think will deal with Maoris question again but you know I think before going to nature,</span> <span title="1:22:13 - 1:22:19">which is something I feel like it lacks a villain you know this is next part that.</span> <span title="1:22:19 - 1:22:27">Ultimately Barrys point me antagonist it it is major it's just that there's no villain and I think maybe it is interesting about Little Miss Sunshine.</span> <span title="1:22:28 - 1:22:32">And Shane a monster is really in comparison to Die Hard and misery,</span> <span title="1:22:32 - 1:22:40">unless to lesser extent three billboards is there is a lack of the Cleveland and that's something we should have pointed out of the beginning and maybe we should point out the beginning buy you anything this and say,</span> <span title="1:22:40 - 1:22:47">resisting about Little Miss Sunshine chain and wants to give us a self and part of the reason that herself is that there is a lack of a Cleveland.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:22:48]</small> <span title="1:22:48 - 1:22:50">As we were going to.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:22:50]</small> <span title="1:22:50 - 1:22:55">I think I might know I'm about to beginning cause I think that's a nice Point to end it on.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:22:56]</small> <span title="1:22:56 - 1:23:08">So given that we're giving them a come up over the time that we met we set up cells were these parts I did you want to try and reveal whether or not you've had any particular learning.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:23:09]</small> <span title="1:23:09 - 1:23:19">I've got a few learning but I think my main one is actually harkening back to a feeling I got from Die Hard which was.</span> <span title="1:23:19 - 1:23:28">The idea of John mcclane was carved out by the antagonistic forces and that was really.</span> <span title="1:23:28 - 1:23:32">Reinforced in this part vs Self where.</span> <span title="1:23:33 - 1:23:40">If the self is the antagonist in every single app interaction that character has would be by nature.</span> <span title="1:23:40 - 1:23:53">Antagonistic you know and and that's a wonderful byproduct I think of having the self be the generator of both the external and inert articles of the characters but the thing that really.</span> <span title="1:23:53 - 1:23:59">Blew my mind a little bit was when you were talking about the structure of monster that Patty Jenkins.</span> <span title="1:24:00 - 1:24:08">Created and how her holding back of the reveal changes what the antagonistic forces in the film are.</span> <span title="1:24:08 - 1:24:10">If they've started with.</span> <span title="1:24:10 - 1:24:23">Lee's wound or herb background like her childhood abuse then the antagonistic forces would have been pissy very differently they would have been almost.</span> <span title="1:24:23 - 1:24:31">No feeling that Lee had character or agency in a lot of her decisions where is by choosing when to reveal it.</span> <span title="1:24:32 - 1:24:40">Yeah it really hardly out in a cat as a character in a way that I think I will be mulling for some time.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:24:41]</small> <span title="1:24:41 - 1:24:42">And yourself Stu.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:24:43]</small> <span title="1:24:43 - 1:24:51">Firstly I'm glad to see that my antagonistic forces leading you don't know to blow your mind.</span> <span title="1:24:51 - 1:24:55">That that's pretty cool I guess.</span> <span title="1:24:55 - 1:25:09">I'm just going to touch on everything that's not a cheap one but I think one of the things that I've been talking about since the first episode to think will be clearer went about disaster films is the relationship between the antagonistic Force and genre in a way.</span> <span title="1:25:09 - 1:25:19">Thinking about John Rees inherently related to thinking about what your antagonist is there is a version of monster which is.</span> <span title="1:25:19 - 1:25:29">Where Aileen is actually is the villain that she is the antagonist in Silence of the Lambs it's cammy's detect his catch Aileen 40 Kills Again.</span> <span title="1:25:29 - 1:25:30">Right there is a version of that film.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:25:30]</small> <span title="1:25:30 - 1:25:43">Or or even from even a film that take Selby's point of view even more like he's someone who should you sell be in to go on a ride into the darkness kinda thing.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:25:43]</small> <span title="1:25:43 - 1:25:49">And I'm in able to be a big brush strokes there but it is kind of like a brick brushstroke thing.</span> <span title="1:25:50 - 1:26:01">I suspect when people can see them their ideas they probably conceiving of the antagonistic forces part of it weather and all the conscious of it so you wanted to kind of went out cuz I think I'll keep on coming back to it.</span> <span title="1:26:02 - 1:26:08">Speaking of Selby the other thing in this this will lead to a big appointment pressure but I think what are things that we didn't touch on.</span> <span title="1:26:08 - 1:26:16">On Monster bit I have been thinking about it kinda hit me and I think it's related to the other films is the importance of secret.</span> <span title="1:26:17 - 1:26:29">And it something comes up at I thinking I guess what has come over me when working on television shows the characters needs secrets that they keeping from eachother whether they're consciously telling lies or they're lying to admission,</span> <span title="1:26:29 - 1:26:38">this information they don't want to reveal and in this case Aileen in particular is information she does want to reveal for Selby nearly did she is actually killing so she's lying about it.</span> <span title="1:26:38 - 1:26:48">And also confirmation that she does want to reveal to her self but what's important is loaded scenes between Silvia nailene is it there is pressure.</span> <span title="1:26:48 - 1:26:56">This is a keyword pressure on a lean to confess to sell me that she's indeed killing them.</span> <span title="1:26:56 - 1:27:07">And also I guess it in a way maybe Selby herself her acquiescence if not her affectedly she's effectively no complice do it's going on and when,</span> <span title="1:27:07 - 1:27:15">Aileen makes a choice she's put under pressure again that she's put on the pressure at the end when Selby holes.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:27:15]</small> <span title="1:27:15 - 1:27:21">With the offices listening in an alias wanted to pressure to bed either,</span> <span title="1:27:21 - 1:27:28">too involved or to effectively drive on the hand grenade and take the blame herself to say was all her,</span> <span title="1:27:28 - 1:27:37">and that pressure results in daily making that decision so I think it's a very late stage we need to just the idea of pressure.</span> <span title="1:27:37 - 1:27:46">But it's something that I do think about a lot and in some ways I think is a rider pressure is a more tangible tool.</span> <span title="1:27:47 - 1:27:50">Van antagonistic forces as much as reviving technical.</span> <span title="1:27:51 - 1:27:54">Putting a character under pressure and.</span> <span title="1:27:54 - 1:28:02">You put under pressure and you keep on increasing the pressure to you force them to make a choice or to change,</span> <span title="1:28:02 - 1:28:11">and I think that is coming back to the example used in like episode one about the two person running along in the horror movie being chased by the monster of the Killer and then try and use the door handle.</span> <span title="1:28:11 - 1:28:19">That doesn't seem like a big ears pretty McCarter under pressure because the couch at that point had an escape plan to me Danny and then need to make a decision in the moment how to be very mine ute,</span> <span title="1:28:19 - 1:28:30">paper obstacle words like I'll make they bash the glass in try to hotwire a car or they want in a different direction either way increasing the pressure on the character and I think lies and particular are,</span> <span title="1:28:30 - 1:28:34">something that you can probably doing most dramas it characters.</span> <span title="1:28:34 - 1:28:45">Withhold information from each other so you write things in which they're under pressure to tell the truth or to confront their own lie and I think that is true live in shame.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:28:45]</small> <span title="1:28:45 - 1:28:53">As well he's lying to himself in certainly is lying to other people about the pawn and everything in he's under pressure.</span> <span title="1:28:53 - 1:29:03">And the film find ways to decreasing the pressure on him even though it's less specifically goal related anything in a Little Miss Sunshine when they get there.</span> <span title="1:29:03 - 1:29:05">It's a series of escalation isn't it.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:29:05]</small> <span title="1:29:05 - 1:29:15">Yeah I know and they're each putting pressure on each other I mean to give me I think in future episodes we're gonna find.</span> <span title="1:29:15 - 1:29:20">Clear examples of what you mean by pressure.</span> <span title="1:29:21 - 1:29:26">For the moment I'm going to stick with antagonistic forces in well and I'll see if you can burn me.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:29:26]</small> <span title="1:29:26 - 1:29:40">Well it's it's more I guess pressure is a sequential it's a process putting character under pressure can't got a verbal verb is it a verb is it very cold that is terrible English.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:29:40]</small> <span title="1:29:40 - 1:29:42">An active.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:29:42]</small> <span title="1:29:42 - 1:29:49">Yeah it's kinda active when we go to under pressure is a lot more active than antagonistic Force.</span> <span title="1:29:49 - 1:30:02">There is putting I'm in pressure is obviously a noun but you can it was also operates as it is a vertical vs depressurise you push you pull whatever having implies all those things I like it because it's gonna Matt.</span> <span title="1:30:03 - 1:30:10">Activeness and a bit it's also a process ultimately the over the course of Shame.</span> <span title="1:30:10 - 1:30:15">Brandon is pressurised until Ultima he does well we believe he does something about his addiction.</span> <span title="1:30:16 - 1:30:24">In Monster Aileen the Sequence of Events put her under pressure initially so she's start committing murders right.</span> <span title="1:30:24 - 1:30:29">And then ultimately her taking until she then fucks up,</span> <span title="1:30:29 - 1:30:35">courses that did the Sequence of Events pressures right her until she fucks up and.</span> <span title="1:30:35 - 1:30:48">She is a police officer gets a quarter come in what actually specifically get to enchant no it's the car so lationship between her and Selby that leads to them getting caught but ultimately and then she confesses in and then she also takes to complete rats what's going on.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:30:48]</small> <span title="1:30:48 - 1:30:58">Oh ok can I can I jump in on Monster quickly cuz I think what's interesting is that when Lee starts almost planning murders and choosing to murder when there is.</span> <span title="1:30:59 - 1:31:03">Not that pressured like she's not under self defence she's not suffering from.</span> <span title="1:31:04 - 1:31:10">PTSD at least that's how Patty Jenkins represents those the later murders.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:31:10]</small> <span title="1:31:10 - 1:31:17">But she's pressurised into doing it because we seen her try to get work and she's failed to do that she's been watered.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:31:17]</small> <span title="1:31:17 - 1:31:20">Will know she's pressured to go back into hooking not into murdering.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:31:20]</small> <span title="1:31:20 - 1:31:21">Yeah buddy.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:31:21]</small> <span title="1:31:21 - 1:31:35">Anna and me choice that she ends up making is to murder people for money so the pressure changes from PTSD or self defence or a lack of choice from her upbringing to being.</span> <span title="1:31:35 - 1:31:41">Well this is a good way to earn a living or the only way I can earn a living is she in a way she kind of embraces it and.</span> <span title="1:31:42 - 1:31:49">The only reason I raise that as an example is because I think that's the point the truck the movies trying to make anyway before we get.</span> <span title="1:31:50 - 1:31:55">Two lost in the wilderness again just passed a tune for hopefully a.</span> <span title="1:31:56 - 1:32:05">Relatively quick release of Part 3 of this exploration of antagonist which will be the nature.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:32:05]</small> <span title="1:32:05 - 1:32:14">And we'll be here just in case someone watch anything will be looking at all is lost the grey and Contagion.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:32:14]</small> <span title="1:32:14 -

## Mindhunter {#chapter}

**Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:33:41]</small> <span title="1:33:41 - 1:33:45">I'm in a tangential eyes briefly.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:33:44]</small> <span title="1:33:44 - 1:33:46">Yes.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:33:46]</small> <span title="1:33:46 - 1:33:59">Traffic this is another good example they found that does this which is what I was watching monster right this was the first time I watched it was for this and I can't help but having watched mindhunter last year was one of the best ones I saw last year.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:34:01]</small> <span title="1:34:01 - 1:34:03">A 10 hour movie.</span> **Excerpts:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:34:04]</small> <span title="1:34:04 - 1:34:14">40 years ago your FBI was founded hunting down John Dillinger now we have extreme violence between strangers.</span> <span title="1:34:15 - 1:34:16">Or are they formed.</span> <span title="1:34:16 - 1:34:30">Psychopaths I'm convinced there's nothing wrong with them so she's been officially impossible to study that you were found a way in near perfect laboratory conditions lol that's what makes this so exciting potentially so far reaching,</span> <span title="1:34:30 - 1:34:39">thighs rub off on me the weather few sex with women it is not our god the commiserate with his people it is our job to electrocute them,</span> <span title="1:34:39 - 1:34:44">like everything we do but talking to serial killers,</span> <span title="1:34:43 - 1:34:51">in terminology I'm trying to warn you your attitude is going to bite you in the ass to the ruining peoples lives,</span> <span title="1:34:51 - 1:35:02">you developing a pattern of behaviour that will not say standing here before you leave I can help you.</span> <span title="1:35:02 - 1:35:04">You can't get in the dirt with the pigs.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:35:05]</small> <span title="1:35:05 - 1:35:14">Bill tench does my partner home food from the Federal Bureau of Investigations behavioral science unit we do a research interviewing man like you.</span> <span title="1:35:14 - 1:35:21">Certainly our goal is to be preemptive with the FBI all them that is not home yet.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:35:22]</small> <span title="1:35:22 - 1:35:35">The reason I wanted to bring a mindhunter because this was any Sting Tower, I want to go into detail but felt like what was interesting about mindhunter is it the antagonist over the course of the show I have chain.</span> <span title="1:35:36 - 1:35:45">Right which is that at the beginning of the film out of the show EH Holden.</span> <span title="1:35:45 - 1:35:56">Is kind of NBN take us to hold in his obstacle really is obstacle is the FBI self like him wanting them to modernise.</span> <span title="1:35:56 - 1:36:03">And Bill tench is kind of the like a person applied antagonist of the FBI.</span> <span title="1:36:03 - 1:36:07">All tickle his boss the shepherd is his name.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:36:06]</small> <span title="1:36:06 - 1:36:21">Yeah I would say the boss more so I definitely tench is an external antagonist in external human antagonist but it's more in the late buddy cop kind of thing two different people thrown together on a road trip and how they rub off on each other so.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:36:20]</small> <span title="1:36:20 - 1:36:23">And they're all these all these forces and challenging Holden.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:36:23]</small> <span title="1:36:23 - 1:36:29">I mean I would say EH Holden challenges change more than Kent tench challenges Holden.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:36:29]</small> <span title="1:36:29 - 1:36:37">Even in the Mist the kind of how they use Debbie's Gulf like his girlfriend is it just in case she is.</span> <span title="1:36:37 - 1:36:45">You know kind of like almost a cappuccino manic pixie dream girl in the context of a Serial of a finches,</span> <span title="1:36:45 - 1:36:52">show where she is there to enable Holden to become the,</span> <span title="1:36:52 - 1:37:01">hegel science cuz she opens up his eyes to kinda villains in psychology but it's because obviously each each episode structurally is about a,</span> <span title="1:37:01 - 1:37:10">almost each episode is about a difference you're killing and they are the antagonist within same but ultimately where the show goes is that Holden in a way,</span> <span title="1:37:10 - 1:37:23">is the idea that you almost what it's trying to say is that to catch a psychopath you need to be a psychopath that Holden's and they make an earlier comment about serial killing it's actually Wendy Carr he does it.</span> <span title="1:37:24 - 1:37:31">That psychopathy manifests in different ways and serial killing is one way.</span> <span title="1:37:32 - 1:37:39">Psychopathy manifests but not the only one stocks a business and to me what is she's actually talking about is holding.</span> <span title="1:37:40 - 1:37:43">That's kind of a thematic I did that Holden has become.</span> <span title="1:37:43 - 1:37:57">Come if not always been kind of a psychopath and he's obsessed with the project that people around you can kinda tend to have emotions but people are only there to enable him which is why I think which change the kind of relationship to the girlfriend,</span> <span title="1:37:56 - 1:38:01">a little bit because you go you only seeing him how he sees her which is.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:38:02]</small> <span title="1:38:02 - 1:38:15">A tool to enable himself and then the B series filmed ultimately ends with him kind of collapsing in a panic attack at the end because he's actually actually knowing mint camper,</span> <span title="1:38:16 - 1:38:25">say that we like doesn't keep it more or less a we ever say he doesn't hold you or me end of the year you and me where to say.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:38:24]</small> <span title="1:38:24 - 1:38:26">Belarc.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:38:25]</small> <span title="1:38:25 - 1:38:34">About what right but I think the difference is this electric simile into Monster for is not self aware.</span> <span title="1:38:34 - 1:38:46">I might shame where he is Brandon and Shane Brandon is a where it is addiction but doesn't see this problem Richard in Little Miss Sunshine doesn't but I think it is even more.</span> <span title="1:38:46 - 1:38:54">Oblivious to himself so the upskill he needs overcome is himself but a forces of change are external.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:38:54]</small> <span title="1:38:54 - 1:39:02">Yeah yeah absolutely what I say as I mean look at they got the luxury of 10 hours to tell their story.</span> <span title="1:39:02 - 1:39:11">So they do dramatise his change towards being the antagonist of the show as well as the protagonist.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:39:11]</small> <span title="1:39:11 - 1:39:13">Yes it can't be OK yeah.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:39:13]</small> <span title="1:39:13 - 1:39:18">Is because they have overtime you know initially he has Allah is like tench is his,</span> <span title="1:39:18 - 1:39:27">hello his girlfriend is his Ally he's winning over these serial killers and they see him as a friend everyone looks at him favorably,</span> <span title="1:39:27 - 1:39:37">and it's only as his actions it starts with the him getting involved like it starts with him getting cocky and arrogant with the finding of that.</span> <span title="1:39:37 - 1:39:47">Where they were they sold one murder but then it's really his involvement with that school headmaster where he sees the impacts of his.</span> <span title="1:39:48 - 1:39:53">Of his metalink and does not get affected by it.</span> <span title="1:39:54 - 1:40:07">And you know it it impacts on his relationship such that his girlfriend breaks up with him he's getting problems with tench and even Shepard who's been the classic antagonist start seeming like he's making sense,</span> <span title="1:40:07 - 1:40:11">so that they got the luxury of time to convert him into.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:40:12]</small> <span title="1:40:12 - 1:40:15">Those went and seen it and are happy to be spoilt.</span> <span title="1:40:17 - 1:40:23">In my mind Hunter there's basically a teacher whose baby with children is very questionable at best.</span> <span title="1:40:23 - 1:40:34">And he becomes involved for becomes involved with the school with this principle waves and he basically advisors the school too.</span> <span title="1:40:34 - 1:40:44">Drop in because he's considered a threat to the kids that this inappropriate pinching could lead to something else tickling.</span> <span title="1:40:44 - 1:40:57">And he ends up in finder many and the wife of this guy comes around and says it was in a harmless you I dare you and you completely Unapologetic by human.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:40:56]</small> <span title="1:40:56 - 1:41:03">You later see the that you see you the Pam isolator like drunk and wandering the streets the principal.</span> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:41:05]</small> <span title="1:41:05 - 1:41:07">Headmaster such a British term.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:41:08]</small> <span title="1:41:08 - 1:41:15">Hahaha sorry you get to get your he gets more more again he becomes he he.</span> <span title="1:41:15 - 1:41:29">Promote stay we duck the transfer but there's always think yeah he becomes more and more the villain do I need to use the word and take us because more more the villain to the other characters but ultimately he's undermining himself is undermining his own purpose.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:41:29]</small> <span title="1:41:29 - 1:41:36">And it's and it's his lack of it basically the audience is giving an insight into his personality that he does not see.</span> <span title="1:41:36 - 1:41:45">So he starts becoming the obstacles to his own journey his own want is to you no bring behavioural analysis.</span> <span title="1:41:45 - 1:41:57">And behaviour profiling into the FBI to update it to save people like he has all these ultra sick intentions that he's seen early on is this altruistic Boy Scout and then it gets to the point where it's about him.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:41:57]</small> <span title="1:41:57 - 1:41:58">His fame.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:41:58]</small> <span title="1:41:58 - 1:42:03">And he's working against his own interest and he cannot see that.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:42:02]</small> <span title="1:42:02 - 1:42:09">You got it so it's not just that he's becoming a psychopath a part of these you want the answer me back like Tempo wants.</span> **Chas Fisher:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:42:07]</small> <span title="1:42:07 - 1:42:21">And that's what I mean is that he becomes the antagonist because not just is he the antagonist to the other characters but he's the obstacle to his own objectives.</span> **Stu Willis:** <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:42:21]</small> <span title="1:42:21 - 1:42:29">And I think that is something not dissimilar to the Steve Jobs movie which also has very three very clear axe.</span>
