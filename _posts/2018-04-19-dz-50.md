https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6DnLLkV0zo *How can characters be their own antagonist?* In Part Two of our Five Part Epic Exploration™ into antagonists, Chas & Stu take a look at "vs self" stories. Stories where the protagonist (or main character) serves as their own antagonist as well as the antagonist for those around them. It took us a long time to settle on our homework, but we ended up exploring LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, SHAME, and MONSTER. Our discussion continues in backmatter with MINDHUNTER and STEVE JOBS. As a result of our exploration, we manage to get a better understanding of our 'thesu' on: internal vs external change; obstacles and pressure; stories without singular antagonists; and how it really is the antagonistic forces that carve out the protagonist’s journey. As always: **SPOILERS ABOUND!** Audio quotations used for educational purposes only. Timestamps indicated below. Chapter markers included in the mp3.
