[podloveaudio src="http://traffic.libsyn.com/draftzero/DZ-49.mp3" title="DZ-49: Antagonists! (Part 1) - vs Humans" duration="01:21:05"] *What makes a strong human antagonist?* Prompted by a listener (and <a href="http://patreon.com/draftzero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patron</a> of the podcast) question, Stu and Chas dive into antagonistic forces. And because Draft Zero does not do anything by halves, this is Part <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One</span> of a Five Part Epic Exploration™ into antagonists; namely: vs humans, vs self, vs nature/supernatural, vs systems and “other”. aka the classic narrative conflicts. For this “vs humans” part, we chose to look at DIE HARD, MISERY and THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE OF EBBING, MISSOURI (with special mentions to THE DARK KNIGHT, LA LA LAND and - of course - STAR WARS). In particular, we look at some classical villains, internal vs external antagonists, and how antagonists and protagonists can swap roles over a scene or a sequence. As always: **SPOILERS ABOUND** Audio quotations used for educational purposes only. Timestamps indicated below. Chapter markers included in the mp3. Special thanks to our Patreon supporters.
